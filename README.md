# Get your T-rex 

## Project Description
Get your T-rex is a marketplace app for renting a dinosaur. The application allows the user to see all of the available dinosaurs for rental, as well as see further details of the individual dinosaur. The user can then book a dinosaur, or leave a review for the dinosaur that they have rented. As a user you can also add a new dinosaur to the database. The project was completed in one week in a multi-disciplinary team of four and was part of the curriculum of the Le Wagon Web Development Course.
